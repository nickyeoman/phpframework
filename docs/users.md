# Working with Users

User Authentication is needed in the vast majority of web projects, so it's included in this framework.

## Setup

The User class and appropriate pages were setup during the run of newProject.bash

The newProject script added the following:
* views/user/ directory
* controller/user.php controller/class
* migration/user_migration (don't change)

You can customize them to your liking.

### The Registration Page

The registration page is found at /user/registration

# Disable users
